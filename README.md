# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that facilitates structured, progressive thinking through defined stages. This tool helps break down complex problems into sequential thoughts, track the progression of your thinking process, and generate summaries.

## Features

- **Structured Thinking Framework**: Organizes thoughts through standard cognitive stages (Problem Definition, Research, Analysis, Synthesis, Conclusion)
- **Thought Tracking**: Records and manages sequential thoughts with metadata
- **Related Thought Analysis**: Identifies connections between similar thoughts
- **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks your position in the overall thinking sequence
- **Summary Generation**: Creates concise overviews of the entire thought process
- **Persistent Storage**: Automatically saves your thinking sessions
- **Data Import/Export**: Share and reuse thinking sessions
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily customize and extend functionality

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- UV package manager ([Install Guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))

## Quick Start

1. **Set Up Project**
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix

   # Install package and dependencies
   uv pip install -e .

   # For development with testing tools
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

   # For all optional dependencies
   uv pip install -e ".[all]"
   ```

2. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   # Run directly
   uv run -m mcp_sequential_thinking.server

   # Or use the installed script
   mcp-sequential-thinking
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run with coverage report
   pytest --cov=mcp_sequential_thinking
   ```

## Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\your\\mcp-sequential-thinking\\run_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\mcp-sequential-thinking"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, if you've installed the package with `pip install -e .`, you can use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "mcp-sequential-thinking"
    }
  }
}
```

# How It Works

The server maintains a history of thoughts and processes them through a structured workflow. Each thought is validated, categorized, and stored with relevant metadata for later analysis.

## Usage Guide

The Sequential Thinking server exposes three main tools:

### 1. `process_thought`

Records and analyzes a new thought in your sequential thinking process.

**Parameters:**

- `thought` (string): The content of your thought
- `thought_number` (integer): Position in your sequence (e.g., 1 for first thought)
- `total_thoughts` (integer): Expected total thoughts in the sequence
- `next_thought_needed` (boolean): Whether more thoughts are needed after this one
- `stage` (string): The thinking stage - must be one of:
  - "Problem Definition"
  - "Research"
  - "Analysis"
  - "Synthesis"
  - "Conclusion"
- `tags` (list of strings, optional): Keywords or categories for your thought
- `axioms_used` (list of strings, optional): Principles or axioms applied in your thought
- `assumptions_challenged` (list of strings, optional): Assumptions your thought questions or challenges

**Example:**

```python
# First thought in a 5-thought sequence
process_thought(
    thought="The problem of climate change requires analysis of multiple factors including emissions, policy, and technology adoption.",
    thought_number=1,
    total_thoughts=5,
    next_thought_needed=True,
    stage="Problem Definition",
    tags=["climate", "global policy", "systems thinking"],
    axioms_used=["Complex problems require multifaceted solutions"],
    assumptions_challenged=["Technology alone can solve climate change"]
)
```

### 2. `generate_summary`

Generates a summary of your entire thinking process.

**Example output:**

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalThoughts": 5,
    "stages": {
      "Problem Definition": 1,
      "Research": 1,
      "Analysis": 1,
      "Synthesis": 1,
      "Conclusion": 1
    },
    "timeline": [
      {"number": 1, "stage": "Problem Definition"},
      {"number": 2, "stage": "Research"},
      {"number": 3, "stage": "Analysis"},
      {"number": 4, "stage": "Synthesis"},
      {"number": 5, "stage": "Conclusion"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. `clear_history`

Resets the thinking process by clearing all recorded thoughts.

## Practical Applications

- **Decision Making**: Work through important decisions methodically
- **Problem Solving**: Break complex problems into manageable components
- **Research Planning**: Structure your research approach with clear stages
- **Writing Organization**: Develop ideas progressively before writing
- **Project Analysis**: Evaluate projects through defined analytical stages


## Getting Started

With the proper MCP setup, simply use the `process_thought` tool to begin working through your thoughts in sequence. As you progress, you can get an overview with `generate_summary` and reset when needed with `clear_history`.



# Customizing the Sequential Thinking Server

For detailed examples of how to customize and extend the Sequential Thinking server, see [example.md](example.md). It includes code samples for:

- Modifying thinking stages
- Enhancing thought data structures
- Adding persistence
